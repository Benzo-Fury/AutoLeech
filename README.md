# AutoLeech
Autoleech is a unfinished CLI tool that allows you to run and use PCILeech from a better and easier to use interface. The CLI has not been created to replace PCILeech. The PCILeech binary still needs to be downloaded to use this software.

## Dislaimer 
The project is currently unfinished and untested. Highly unrecommended that you **don't use this** at the moment.
